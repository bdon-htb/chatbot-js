# Aliza Chatbot chatbot-js

Aliza (or ALIZA) is a simple chatbot that I made as a submission for PyJac Rebooted.

Aliza's name is a portmanteau of the names Alice (A.L.I.C.E.) and Eliza who
are older chatbots that Aliza was based on. Aliza even uses a custom markup language
that is very similar to AIML. You can read more about it in the notes directory
of this repo.

PyJac is a hackathon run by students at UTM. Participants are given a selection
of prompts to choose and are then given a week to code and submit it with a video demonstration.

## Developing

## Built With
Aliza was developed using modern / ES6 JavaScript.

## Prerequisites
I recommend running Aliza on a local server. To do this, I personally use python3's
http.server. If you don't already have python installed you can get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Getting Started
Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/bdon-htb/chatbot-js
```
And then run a local server.
```
cd chatbot-js/src
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open your browser of choice (I suggest in private browsing), navigate to localhost:8000 and the webpage should load.
